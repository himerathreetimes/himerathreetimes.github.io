    <strong>Marcy the Baptist is the musical project of American multimedia artist Alexei Petrov. A student film composer and 
        Boston DIY face, Alexei began the project in the later weeks of December 2022 to cope with splitting headaches caused by Strattera 
        withdrawal. Initially intended as a spiteful display of what Rock and Roll could be unencumbered by collegiate retrophelia, the project quickly morphed into 
        a practical experiment in narrative Pop. As it has remained since.
